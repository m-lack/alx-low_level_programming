Task 0: Print List
Implement a function that prints all elements of a linked list and returns the number of nodes. It showcases basic list traversal.

Task 1: List Length
Create a function to count and return the number of elements in a linked list. It demonstrates how to determine the length of a linked list.

Task 2: Add Node
Write a function to add a new node at the beginning of a linked list. It illustrates adding elements to the front of the list.

Task 3: Add Node at the End
Develop a function to add a new node at the end of a linked list. It demonstrates appending elements to the end of the list.

Task 4: Free List
Implement a function to free the memory occupied by a linked list. It shows how to release allocated memory for all nodes.

Task 5: Free (Set Head to NULL)
Create a function that frees a linked list and sets its head to NULL. It highlights freeing memory and updating the head pointer.

Task 6: Pop
Write a function that deletes the head node of a linked list and returns its data. It demonstrates removing the first element.

Task 7: Get Node at Index
Implement a function to return the nth node of a linked list, starting from 0. It illustrates accessing a specific node in the list.

Task 8: Sum List
Develop a function that returns the sum of all elements in a linked list. It showcases calculating the sum of node values.

Task 9: Insert Node at Index
Create a function to insert a new node at a specified index in a linked list. It demonstrates inserting elements at a given position.

Task 10: Delete Node at Index
Write a function to delete the node at a specified index in a linked list. It shows removing elements at a particular position.

Task 11: Reverse List
Implement a function to reverse a linked list without using more than one loop or dynamic memory allocation. It demonstrates reversing the order of elements in a list.

Task 12: Print (Safe Version)
Create a function that prints a linked list safely, handling lists with loops. It showcases printing a linked list without causing infinite loops and exits with status 98 if the function fails.
