Script to Print Single-Digit Numbers (5-print_numbers.c):

This script prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
It uses a while loop to iterate from 0 to 9 and the putchar function to print each digit as a character.
The loop converts the digits to their ASCII representations by adding '0' to them.
Script to Print Single-Digit Numbers (6-print_numberz.c):

This script also prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
Similar to the previous script, it uses a while loop and the putchar function.
It prints the digits without converting them to ASCII by directly adding '0' to them.
Script to Print Lowercase Alphabet in Reverse (7-print_tebahpla.c):

This script prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
It uses a while loop to iterate from 'z' down to 'a' and the putchar function to print each letter.
Script to Print All Numbers of Base 16 in Lowercase (8-print_base16.c):

This script prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, followed by a new line.
It uses two while loops: one for digits '0' to '9' and another for lowercase letters 'a' to 'f'.
The putchar function is used to print each digit or letter.
Script to Print Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers (9-print_comb.c):

This script prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces, followed by a new line.
It uses a while loop to iterate through the digits from 0 to 9 and putchar to print each digit.
It includes logic to print a comma and space after each digit except for the last one.
Script to Print Combinations of Two-Digit Numbers (100-print_comb3.c):

This script prints all possible different combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces, followed by a new line.
It uses nested while loops to iterate through the digits in ascending order and ensure that the digits are different.
The putchar function is used to print each combination.
Script to Print Combinations of Three-Digit Numbers (101-print_comb4.c):

This script prints all possible different combinations of three two-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces, followed by a new line.
It uses three nested while loops to iterate through the digits in ascending order while ensuring the digits are different.
The putchar function is used to print each combination.
Script to Print Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers (102-print_comb5.c):

This script prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by a space and comma, followed by a new line.
It uses nested for loops to iterate through the numbers from 0 to 98 for num1 and from num1 + 1 to 99 for num2.
The putchar function is used to print each combination of two numbers as two-digit strings.
It ensures that duplicates like "00 01" and "01 00" are not considered by starting num2 from num1 + 1.
