1. _putchar.c and 0-putchar.c: These programs are part of the first task. `_putchar.c` contains the `_putchar` function, which is used to print characters. `0-putchar.c` is the main program that includes `_putchar.c` and uses `_putchar` to print the "_putchar" string followed by a newline.

2. 1-alphabet.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in one line followed by a newline character. It includes the `print_alphabet` function and a `main` function that calls it.

3. 2-print_alphabet_x10.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each on a new line. It includes the `print_alphabet_x10` function and a `main` function that calls it.

4. 3-islower.c: This program defines the `_islower` function, which checks if a character is lowercase. It includes a `main` function that tests the `_islower` function with various characters and prints the results.

5. 4-isalpha.c: This program defines the `_isalpha` function, which checks if a character is an alphabetic character (either lowercase or uppercase). It includes a `main` function that tests the `_isalpha` function with various characters and prints the results.

6. 5-sign.c: This program defines the `print_sign` function, which prints the sign of an integer (positive, zero, or negative) and returns the corresponding value (1, 0, or -1). It includes a `main` function that tests the `print_sign` function with different numbers.

7. 6-abs.c: This program defines the `_abs` function, which calculates the absolute value of an integer. It includes a `main` function that tests the `_abs` function with different numbers.

8. 7-print_last_digit.c: This program defines the `print_last_digit` function, which prints and returns the last digit of an integer. It includes a `main` function that tests the `print_last_digit` function with different numbers.

9. 8-24_hours.c: This program defines the `jack_bauer` function, which prints every minute of a day in the format "HH:MM" (24-hour clock) from 00:00 to 23:59. It includes a `main` function that calls `jack_bauer`.

10. 9-times_table.c: This program defines the `times_table` function, which prints the multiplication table for the numbers 0 to 9. It includes a `main` function that calls `times_table`.

11. 10-add.c: This program defines the `add` function, which calculates and returns the sum of two integers. It includes a `main` function that tests the `add` function with different numbers.

12. 11-print_to_98.c: This program defines the `print_to_98` function, which prints all natural numbers from a given number up to 98. It includes a `main` function that tests the `print_to_98` function with various starting numbers.

13. 101-natural.c: This program calculates and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024. It uses a loop to find and sum these multiples.

14. 102-fibonacci.c: This program prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, separated by commas, starting with 1 and 2.

15. 103-fibonacci.c: This program finds and prints the sum of all even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000.

16. 104-fibonacci.c: This program prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, separated by commas, starting with 1 and 2, without using long long, malloc, pointers, arrays, or structures. It calculates and prints each Fibonacci number iteratively.

17. main.h: This header file contains function prototypes for all the functions used in the programs, allowing them to be used across different source files.
